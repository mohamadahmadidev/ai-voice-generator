## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser and an API key from OpenAI.

### 2. Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There are no build steps or dependencies to install.

### 3. Configuration (Optional)

To make setup even easier, you can create the following files in the root of the project directory:

* **.env**: To automatically load your API key.
    ```
    OPENAI_KEY=your-openai-api-key-goes-here
    ```
* **instraction.txt**: To automatically load custom instructions.
    ```
    Speak in a calm and clear voice.
    ```
* **text.txt**: To automatically load the text you want to convert.
    ```
    This is the text that will be converted to speech.
    ```

### 4. Running the App

1.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  If you haven't created a `.env` file, enter your OpenAI API Key in the input field.

4.  Enter the text you want to convert to speech.
5.  Select the desired output format and voice.
6.  Click "Generate & Download".
